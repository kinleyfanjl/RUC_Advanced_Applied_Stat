# RUC_Advanced_Applied_Stat
This project is the final project for the course AAS in spring 2019.

Because of divided data tables and seperate tasks, as well as for increasing readability, I save some core parts in different branches of this project. This file is a brief introduction for this AAS project. In different branches, there are codes file and several brief comments for using what I learned in AAS to solve problems in reality.

Final report is coming, I'm trying my best...
Keep working...
